#In addition to using pre-defined functions, you can create your own functions by using the def statement.
#Here is an example of a function named my_func. It takes no arguments, and prints "spam" three times. It is defined, and then called. The statements in the function are executed only when the function is called.
def my_func():
   print("spam")
   print("spam")
   print("spam")

my_func()
#You must define functions before they are called, in the same way that you must assign variables before using them.

#Arguments
#All the function definitions we've looked at so far have been functions of zero arguments, which are called with empty parentheses. 
#However, most functions take arguments.
#The example below defines a function that takes one argument:

def print_with_exclamation(word):
   print(word + "!")
    
print_with_exclamation("spam")
print_with_exclamation("eggs")
print_with_exclamation("python")

def print_sum_twice(x, y):
   print(x + y)
   print(x + y)
print_sum_twice(5, 8)
